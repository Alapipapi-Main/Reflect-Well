    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure data isolation and straightforward security rules by leveraging path-based ownership. Each user has their own collection of journal entries, eliminating the need for complex authorization logic or cross-collection queries for access control. This design achieves Authorization Independence by structuring data such that access control can be determined directly from the path and the `request.auth.uid`, avoiding the need to `get()` parent documents for authorization checks.\n\nThe structure supports the required QAPs as follows:\n\n1.  **Secure `list` operations**: Because each user's journal entries are stored under their specific `userId`, listing entries is inherently secure. Rules can easily enforce that only the authenticated user can list entries within their own `/users/{userId}/journalEntries` collection.\n\n2.  **Data Isolation**: User data is naturally isolated due to the path-based ownership model, preventing unauthorized access or modification.\n\n3.  **Scalability**: The design scales well because read and write operations are limited to a user's own data, avoiding potential bottlenecks associated with shared collections or complex authorization schemes."
